        "The project titled “Amazon Prime TV and Movie Trends – An EDA Approach” focuses on uncovering hidden patterns, insights, and trends within Amazon Prime’s publicly available TV show and movie dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). As a growing OTT platform, Amazon Prime continuously adds content in various genres, formats, and regions. To maintain user satisfaction and optimize content strategy, it’s crucial to understand what types of content perform well, which genres dominate, and how user ratings and other metadata relate to viewership trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "This analysis was conducted individually using Python and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization. The main objective was to derive meaningful business insights that can guide Amazon Prime in its content creation, recommendation strategies, and user engagement improvements.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project began with data loading and initial exploration, identifying missing values, incorrect data types, and anomalies. A thorough data cleaning process was performed, which included handling null values, converting data types (like dates), and standardizing column values (for genres, seasons, etc.). This helped prepare the dataset for deeper analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, univariate and bivariate visualizations were used to explore individual columns and relationships between them. For instance, charts were created to analyze:\n",
        "\t•\tThe number of movies vs. TV shows\n",
        "\t•\tTop contributing countries to Amazon Prime’s content\n",
        "\t•\tMost frequent genres and their IMDB scores\n",
        "\t•\tRelationship between runtime and ratings\n",
        "\t•\tSeasonal trends in content release\n",
        "\t•\tDistribution of IMDb scores across content types and genres\n",
        "\n",
        "These visualizations helped highlight some important insights. For example, movies dominate over TV shows in quantity, but TV shows tend to have slightly higher IMDb ratings on average. It was also observed that genres like Drama, Comedy, and Documentary are the most frequently available, suggesting a content strategy aligned with mass appeal. However, niche genres still maintain consistent viewer ratings.\n",
        "\n",
        "A correlation heatmap was used to identify numerical relationships between variables such as IMDb score, number of votes, seasons, and runtime. A pair plot was used to further explore multi-variable relationships, which added depth to the interpretation of these numerical fields.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final section involved connecting the findings to real-world business objectives. Based on the data, it was clear that Amazon Prime could enhance its recommendation engine by combining genre, runtime, release year, and user rating data. Personalized recommendations based on such features could improve engagement and retention.\n",
        "\n",
        "Other suggested solutions include better content scheduling based on seasonal trends, investing in genres that consistently receive high ratings, and focusing on regional content that shows strong engagement. The project ultimately offers actionable recommendations that, if applied, can help Amazon Prime strengthen its market position by making informed, data-driven content decisions."

        "\n",
        "# Objective 1: Understand Content Distribution\n",
        "# - We found that movies significantly outnumber TV shows.\n",
        "# - Content is heavily skewed towards US, UK, and India.\n",
        "# - Age ratings \"16+\" and \"18+\" are most common, with a large \"Unknown\" category.\n",
        "# Solution: To diversify and potentially increase retention, Amazon Prime could invest more in TV series, particularly those targeting different demographics or international markets beyond the top contributors. Improving age certification data is crucial for targeted marketing and content curation.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Objective 2 & 3: Identify Viewer Preferences and Track Popularity Trends\n",
        "# - Drama, Comedy, and Thriller are the most prevalent genres, indicating broad appeal.\n",
        "# - Average IMDb scores tend to be in the 5-7 range, with fewer critically acclaimed titles.\n",
        "# - There is a trend towards increasing content release over recent years.\n",
        "# - Shorter TV series may have slightly higher average ratings.\n",
        "# Solution: Focus on acquiring or producing high-quality content (aiming for scores > 7.5) across diverse genres. The trend data suggests continued investment is happening, which is positive. Consider promoting shorter series more prominently, as they seem to resonate well.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Objective 4: Support Data-Driven Personalization\n",
        "# - The relationship between IMDb score, votes, and popularity can be used.\n",
        "# - Genre trends and country origins are strong indicators of user preference.\n",
        "# Solution: Enhance recommendation engines by incorporating genre popularity trends over time, average scores by genre and country, and correlation insights. If a user watches a high-rated thriller from a specific country, recommend similar content with high popularity and vote count.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Objective 5: Assist Strategic Planning\n",
        "# - The dominance of certain countries highlights key markets but also potential for expansion elsewhere.\n",
        "# - The distribution of genres suggests areas for both reinforcing strengths and exploring gaps.\n",
        "# Solution: Based on average scores by country, identify regions that consistently produce well-received content for potential partnerships. For genres, continue investing in Drama/Comedy but also explore opportunities in less saturated genres that show high average scores, or invest in higher quality content within lower-scoring popular genres.\n"

        "By identifying high performing genres (like Thriller and Drama) with strong imdb scores and popularity, the platform can priortize these genres in future acquisitions or productions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Enhance Content Discovery:\n",
        "Several titles with high IMDb scores had low popularity, suggesting that quality content is going unnoticed. Targeted promotions and recommendations can increase engagement for such titles.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Time Based Release Strategy:\n",
        "Analysis of yearly release trends shows a steady rise in content volume until a drop in recent years. The platform could analyze user demand vs release volume to align better with viewer expectations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Focus on Highly rated Directors and Production Countries\n",
        "Certain directors and countries consistently yield higher IMDb ratings. Partnering with them could increase content quality and user satisfaction.\n",
